# DOM Manipulation Example

This is a basic HTML file showcasing the use of JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a programming interface for web documents that represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing dynamic access and modification.

## HTML Structure

In this example, we have a simple HTML document containing a div> element with the ID "Div." The JavaScript code within the script> tag demonstrates how to dynamically manipulate the style properties of this div> using the DOM.

## DOM Manipulation

Color: The text color of the div is set to "blue."
Background Color: The background color of the div> is set to "yellow."
Margin: A margin of "20px" is applied around the div>.
Padding: Padding of "10px" is added to the content inside the div>.
Font Size: The font size is set to "18px."
Font Weight: The text is set to bold.
Height and Width: The dimensions of the div> are set to a height of "200px" and a width of "300px."
These manipulations showcase how JavaScript can dynamically alter the visual presentation of HTML elements on a webpage.
